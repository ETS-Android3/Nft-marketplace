# Nft-marketplace :mushroom:

This was originally a school project during my 4th year of computer science and engineering.
*********************************************************************************************
‚ùó note: the spec book did not specify the card to rate, but since non-fungibale tokens are trending, I've figured it was only logical to rate something in the market rather than just a simple object for the test.

# Goals 	:notebook_with_decorative_cover:

1- The main goal behind the project was to implement a recyclerView to display a list of cards. :white_check_mark:

2- Each card on the list should be clickable. :white_check_mark:

3- Each card on the list should have a rating. :white_check_mark:

3- When selecting a card a pop up should appear on the screen to update the rating of the card. :white_check_mark:

4- The app should implement a search filter based on the name of the card. :white_check_mark:

5-  The app should implement a sharing option via social media... :white_check_mark:

6- The app must have a splash screen. :white_check_mark:
