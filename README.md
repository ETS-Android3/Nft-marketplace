# Nft-marketplace :mushroom:

This was originaly a school project during my 4th year of computer science and engineering.
*********************************************************************************************
‚ùó note: the spec book did not specify the card to rate, but since non-fungibale tokens are trending, I've figured it was only logical to rate something in the market rather than just a simple object for the test.
